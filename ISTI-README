==ISTI INTERNAL NOTES: NOT TO BE INCLUDED OR SUBMITTED TO MAIN USGS GROUNDMOTION-PROCESSING REPO==

THIS PROJECT IS ISTI'S FORK OF THE USGS REPO "GROUNDMOTION-PROCESSING" (see the original README)

CHANGES TO REPO CODE WILL BE MAINTAINED HERE UNTIL THE END OF THE PROJECT, AT WHICH POINT:

1) A CONDA PACKAGE (TARBALL) WILL BE CREATED TO BE SUBMITTED TO CLIENT ALONG WITH OUR SCRIPTS

2) WE WILL SUBMIT A "PULL REQUEST" TO THE MAIN USGS REPO, AT WHICH POINT THE USGS CAN DECIDE 
WHETHER OR HOW TO INTEGRATE OUR CHANGES

3)
A- IF OUR CHANGES ARE ACCEPTED BY THE CLIENT, WE WILL:
--TEST TO VERIFY SUBMITTED CODE WORKS AGAINST THE MAINLINE REPO (AS SHOULD BE EXPECTED)
--NOTIFY CLIENT THAT OUR PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED PACKAGE IS NO LONGER NEEDED, AND DOCUMENT STEPS CLIENT
  SHOULD TAKE TO RUN OUR CODE OFF OF MAINLINE REPO (INCLUDING REPO VERSION ETC)

-OR-

B- IF OUR CHANGES OUR **NOT** ACCEPTED, WE WILL:
--PUBLISH OUR REPO AS "PUBLIC", AND NOTIFY THE ORIGINAL MAINTAINERS IN CASE THEY ARE INTERESTED IN 
  LINKING TO OUR REPO AS A FORKED PROJECT
--NOTIFY THE CLIENT THAT THEY ARE TIED TO THE 'FORKED' REPO 
--START DISCUSSION BETWEEN ISTI, USGS MAINTAINERS AND CLIENT AS TO REMEDIATION PLAN MOVING FORWARD
  (EG, WHAT WORK WOULD BE NEEDED TO INTEGRATE FORK WITH MAINLINE, SCHEDULE AND RESOURCES ALLOCATED 
  TO SUCH EFFORT BY RESPECTIVE ORGANIZATIONS)
